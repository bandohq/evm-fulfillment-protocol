/**
 * @title BandoFulfillmentManager
 * 
 * This contract manages services and fulfillables for the Bando protocol.
 * It inherits from OwnableUpgradeable and UUPSUpgradeable contracts.
 * 
 * OwnableUpgradeable provides basic access control functionality, 
 * where only the contract owner can perform certain actions.
 * 
 * UUPSUpgradeable enables the contract to be upgraded without 
 * losing its state, allowing for seamless upgrades of the 
 * contract's implementation logic.
 * 
 * The purpose pf this contract is to interact with the FulfillableRegistry
 * and the BandoFulfillable contracts to perform the following actions:
 * 
 * - Set up a service escrow address and validator address.
 * - Register a fulfillment result for a service.
 * - Withdraw a refund from a service.
 * - Withdraw funds for a beneficiary in a releasable pool.
 * 
 * The owner of the contract is the operator of the fulfillment protocol.
 * But the fulfillers are the only ones that can register a fulfillment result 
 * and withdraw a refund.
 *
