/**
 * @title BandoFulfillableV1
 * @dev Base escrow contract, holds funds designated for a beneficiary until they
 * withdraw them or a refund is emitted.
 *
 * Intended usage: This contract (and derived escrow contracts) should be a
 * standalone contract, that only interacts with the contract that instantiated
 * it. That way, it is guaranteed that all Ether will be handled according to
 * the `Escrow` rules, and there is no need to check for payable functions or
 * transfers in the inheritance tree. The contract that uses the escrow as its
 * payment method should be its owner, and provide public methods redirecting
 * to the escrow's deposit and withdraw.
